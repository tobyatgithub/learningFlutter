## Get-started Tutorial
1. Stateless vs. Stateful  
    `Stateless` widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can’t change—all values are final.  

    `Stateful` widgets maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget. Implementing a stateful widget requires at least two classes: 1) a `StatefulWidget` class that creates an instance of 2) a `State` class. The `StatefulWidget` class is, itself, immutable and can be thrown away and regenerated, but the State class persists over the lifetime of the widget.

    > Prefixing an identifier with an underscore enforces privacy in the Dart language and is a recommended best practice for State objects. (e.g.: `_RandomWordsState`)
